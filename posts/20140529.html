	Just now I was warned by a big boss because of I drawing picture during my working time. She is not the biggest boss, but position is higher than my manager, I'm afraid my following working day will be very hard.

	I think in normal software company, we can spent our time to do anything we want to do, and the precondition is finish our task and do not trouble workmates. Maybe this is the State-owned company, boss don't like employees do other things. <strong>You can do nothing, but you can't do anything except working -- in their opinion</strong>. I hate it, It makes us lack of creativity and personality.
