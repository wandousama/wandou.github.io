	So long time not write codes at here, Because I'm so brave to leave the last company and have a wonderful journey. Do you know where I had gone? 
</p>
<p>
	So regret is not Shangri-La, But also a beautiful place - Jiuzhaigou Valley, I saw the most clean sky and cloud, I saw the lake like a mirror under the sunshine, I saw the melting snow mountain. Most strange things is the weather, Now is sunning, but next second will be raining, So it is very easy to see the rainbow. I always felt hot when under the sunshine, but If no direct sunlight, It would very cold. In a word, Jiuzhaigou Valley is wonderful!

<p>
	And after the journey, I go home to see my grandfather and grandmother and all the relatives. Then back Shanghai with my aunt and two sisters, They want to expand their horizons in big cities. I bring them to see much iconic locations, and delicious restaurants. It's so warm feeling if have relatives at here, but after several days, they back home. I will miss them.
</p>
<p>
	Now I'm working at new company, and doing the things which I have interested in, and work on time, Life is so comfortable.
