	Another year passed by, and my role has changed, I'm married with Jeremy. Haha... Yes he is also a programmer. In my words is "A man who writes code for a living", but he writes Ruby.

    My wedding will be held in October, Maybe is a big trouble for me, so manny things we need to do, and we don't know how to do it. But I also looking forward to our honeymoon trip~ I want to go to Turkey! Turkey!

    Another thing I want to share is we bought a second-hand house in Shanghai, close to my company. The house built in 1995, but had decorated again at 6 years ago, and now the decoration is still good, no need spent much energy to decorate it. I'm soooo happy!! You need know that... I'm a lazy person. My friends (two couples) also bought second-hand house and another friend bought a new house in 2015, Maybe 2015 is a perfect time to buy house.

	My job has totaly changed. Now, I'm working about big data. It's sounds high-class, and also I learned much thing about big data. But I feel a little boring, doing same things day by day. Wish I could make some achievement.
